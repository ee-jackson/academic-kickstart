Source code for my personal website. 

Created with the R package [{blogdown}](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), built on the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator and deployed via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). I'm using the Academic theme [(now Wowchemy)](https://wowchemy.com) - with added tweaks.
