We isolated bacterial strains from the skin of Pyrenean _Alytes obstetricans_ and identified isolates to genus level using 16s rRNA sequencing. Isolates were co-cultured with _Bd_ in-vitro to assess inhibitory ability. We found no evidence of a phylogenetic signal in inhibition of _Bd_. Variation in inhibition among bacterial strains within a genus, was greater than variation between genera. 

The results of this project support a community-level approach to microbiome studies, as highly divergent bacteria can possess similar functional roles and the ecological consequences of augmenting established microbial communities are not fully understood.
