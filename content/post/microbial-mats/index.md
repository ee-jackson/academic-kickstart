The second of my 16-week research projects undertaken as a part of my MRes was based at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London. I could, and do, wax lyrical on the beauty and grandeur of this place. I remember visiting London as a wildlife loving 12-year-old and my dad saying "you could work there one day".

My project at the NHM was my first foray into the study of truly 'wild' communities and naturally diverse environments. I was working with samples of microbial mat communities from meltwater ponds in Antartica.

The McMurdo Ice Shelf in Antartica forms an 50m thick undulating surface of ice floating on the sea. Annual summer thawing of ice and snow causes the formation of thousands of ponds in depressions on the ice. Variable ammounts of trapped marine sediments and salt are released from the ice as it melts. This results in ponds which are very close together in space and yet at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of salinity and pH. 

The meltwater ponds of the McMurdo Ice Shelf are colonised by microbial mats, one of the few things that can survive in these extreme environments. Microbial mats are one of the earliest signs of life found on earth, thought to have been present [4,000 million years ago](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1999.0934). They owe their hardiness to their co-operative nature. The mats are actually composed of lots of different kinds of microorganisms, organised into a multi-layered, three dimentional sheet. Each layer contains organisms with a different functional role. There are oxygen- and sun- loving cyanobacteria in the upper layers gradually giving way to  anaerobic and sulfate- loving bacteria at the lowest levels, with many other groups inbetween. The cyanobacteria at the top convert sunlight into energy and the waste products of the organisms at each layer are then food for the layer below them.

We wanted to find out more about how the different environmental contitions in the ponds related to the community composition of microbial mats.

## What did we do?

We decided to test if communities from mats in the same pond were more similar to each other than communities from mats in different ponds. My supervisor, Anne Jungblut, had spent a field season in Antartica and returned with frozen microbial mat samples from 6 meltwater ponds and measurements of pH, conductivity (a measure of salinity) and temperature from each.

To find out what was living in the mats we had to extract DNA from each sample and amplify it (via PCR) ready for sequencing. This involved lots of high-tech impressive-looking equipment and many failed attempts.

Weeks of hard work were condensed down into 550 nano grams of PCR product in very tiny test tubes and sent to the NHM sequencing facility. After a nail biting wait we were rewarded with reams of DNA sequence data. Matching our data to a database of known DNA sequences for different organisms, we were able to determine the community composition of each of our microbial mat samples.

## So what?

We found that communities from different ponds were all quite different from each other. Mats from the saltiest pond and the most acidic pond were especially different from the others. We also saw that these two ponds - which were at the extremes, had fewer species. Different communities taken from the same pond were very similar. Our results could be suggestive of environmental filtering.

Environmental filtering happens when species arrive at a location but are unable to persist there due to aboitic conditions. Microbial mats. While some species are able to exist in ponds a few meters away the extreme salinity of salt pond prohibits them from establishing there.

Microbial mats accumulative over many years and there are relatively few processes that could provide opportunities for colonization and succession, and thereby introduce spatial variability. Physical disturbance is limited to exposure to wind abrasion following a decline in water level 

captures an important process in community assembly, where species arrive at a site but fail to establish or persist due to an inability to tolerate the abiotic conditions.
