I am a PhD student in the NERC Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantitative and Modelling Skills in Ecology and Evolution (QMEE). Currently investigating the role of pre-dispersal insect seed predators in maintaining tropical plant diversity in Panama. Using long-term datasets of seed rain to model community dynamics and collecting information on individual plant species and their enemies in the field.
