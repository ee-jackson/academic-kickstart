I am a PhD student in the NERC Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantitative and Modelling Skills in Ecology and Evolution (QMEE). I am broadly interested in community ecology, the complexities of ecosystems and how they respond to change.  

My current research focuses on the role of pre-dispersal insect seed predators in maintaining tropical plant diversity in Panama. I am using long-term datasets of seed rain to model community dynamics and collecting information on individual plant species and their enemies in the field.

My previous research has seen me experimentally evolving phytoplankton in mesocosms, culturing bacteria from amphibian microbiomes and sequencing DNA from meltwater ponds in Antarctica.
