## About me

I am a doctoral researcher at the [University of Reading](https://www.reading.ac.uk), funded by the [NERC Centre for Doctoral Training in Quantitative and Modelling Skills in Ecology and Evolution (QMEE)](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/career-and-skills-development/nerc-studentships/directed-training/centres-for-doctoral-training-cdt/centre-for-doctoral-training-in-modelling-and-quantitative-skills-in-ecology-and-evolution/). I am broadly interested in community ecology; the complex interactions between species, how populations can adapt and respond to change, and the resulting impacts on community structure and function.

My current research focuses on the role of pre-dispersal insect seed predators in maintaining plant community diversity. I am using long-term datasets of seed rain to model community dynamics and collecting information on individual plant species and their enemies in the field.

My previous research has seen me experimentally evolving phytoplankton in mesocosms, culturing bacteria from amphibian microbiomes and sequencing DNA from meltwater ponds in Antarctica.
