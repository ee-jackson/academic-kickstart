## Why phytoplankton?

This was my very first research project and it kindled my curiosity in the complexity of ecosystems.

Our undergraduate projects were randomly assigned and when I found out I would be working on phytoplankton in a lab, I was decidedly nonplussed. My idealistic view of an ecologist saw me trekking through unknown lands and discovering new life. 

However, the glass bottles of green-tinged pond water turned out to be a portal to a world in miniture. With incredibly fast generation times and thousands of individuals of different species living together, they were a perfect study system to tease out the mechanisms driving adaption in communities.

Phytoplankton, I learned, were actually also incredibly interesting and important in their own right. Did you know that the oxygen in every other breath you breathe was produced by these tiny water-dwellers? They also form the foundation of food webs in aquatic systems, meaning that changes at the microbial level could have cascading effects all the way up the chain to our big charismatic fish friends.

Due to the laws of thermodynamics, the rate at which phytoplankton photosynthesise and produce oxygen is controlled by temperature. As it gets warmer the rate of photosynthesis increases untill it reaches a point where the plankton can't handle it and O2 production drops rapidly.
Being so sensitive to temperature you may wonder how phytoplankton will fare on our rapidly warming planet in the future. Will they be able keep up with the speed of change and keep our aquatic ecosystems running?

Previous work done by the lab group had shown that the phytoplankton _Chlorella vulgaris_, in isolation, could change it's thermal metabolic niche in sync with rising temperatures through rapid evolution [(Padfield _et al_. 2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/ele.12545). I was joining a project which would try to test if this response scaled up to whole communities of different phytoplankton species living together.

## What did we do?

The project used a semi-natural system of 20 man-made ponds in Dorset. The ponds were built 10 years prior and seeded with an innoculum of common phytoplankton species. Half of the ponds are kept at 3-5 degrees warmer than ambient temperature to simulate the warmer ponds we might see in the future. The idea was to see if a community arose in the warmed ponds that was better able to deal with higher temperatures. Every month for a year we visited the ponds and returned back to the lab with 20 bottles of pond water sloshing around in the boot of the car. 

{{< figure src="winterPonds.jpeg" title="The ponds in the winter of 2015. The pond closest to the camera has been experimentally heated - no ice has formed on the surface" numbered="false" lightbox="true" >}}

We categorised the thermal metabolic niche of the phytoplankton communities using the dreaded Oxy-lab\* (how fast do they produce O2 at different temperatures?) and characterised the communities using flow cytometry and genetic barcoding (what kinds of plankton are in each pond and how many of each?). We also grew the communities at different temperatures to test if they were better adapted to (reproduced faster in) warmer or cooler climes. 

Beacuse we did this over the course of a year we would not only be able to look at differences between heated and ambient pond communities but also see how their responses to temperature changed with the seasons.

This project produced a slew of data, which is still being probed. From the subset that I analysed for my undergraduate project (Oxy-lab and flow cytometry data for 6 months) we found that the communities were more different from month to month than between heated and ambient treatments. This is really cool. Let me explain.

## So what?

As I mentioned above, we wanted to see if __one__ phytoplankton species adapting to temperature would be the same as __many__ phytoplankton species adapting to temperature. A single species in isolation can adapt via rapid evolution but we didn't find any evidence of this in our pond communities. There was no difference in thermal metabolic niche between ambient and heated communities when pooled across months. This suggested to us that there was something more complicated going on.

Imagine the workforce of a postal service. Each employee is really good at the particular task which they are assigned to. People who work at the counter have a different skill set to people who deliver the post or people who organise the smooth delivery of your letters behind the scenes. Now imagine a scenario where the envrionment changes and suddenly the company has decided to open 30 new branches requiring more staff to work at the counters in the stores. The people who deliver the post and who work in operations could learn a new skill set and switch roles to help cover the increased demand for in-store staff, but this would probably take significantly longer than just hiring more people who already have the required skill set.

As the seasons changed for our pond communities and higher or lower thermal niches become more efficient, members of the community who were better suited to the current temperature reproduced faster (or were "_hired_"), displacing others and changing the community composition. This is sometimes called species turnover. In comparison, a single species in isolation would need to rapidly evolve (or "_learn a new skill_") to adapt to the new temperature.

Now, it is probable that there was some adaptive evolution going on that we didn't detect and this will be better understood once the growth data has been analysed. However, I think this is a really cool example of how the complexities of ecosystems and communities can produce responses that you don't expect. These little battles are going on all around you right now, I bet you'll never look at a puddle of water in the same way again!

I feel so privilaged to have been a part of this project and am immensley grateful to Elisa Schaum who was the mastermind behind this project and everyone else in Gabriel Yvon-Durocher's lab for having made me feel like a scientist for the first time.

\*Actually an incredibly useful bit of kit, just very tempermental.. 

Here are some papers that also use the pond set-up:
