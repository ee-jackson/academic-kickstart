Phytoplankton are the foundation of aquatic ecosystems and condtirubte to 50% of global primary production. In a rapidly changing climate, we expect phytoplankton will will also adapt and change. Changes in temperature scale with the rate of phytoplankton photosynthesis and respiration up to an optimum. This optimum temperature is higher for a community of phytoplankton species as aposed to a population of a single species, contrary to the theory of metabolic ecology.

In collaboration with my undergraduate supervisors, Elisa Schaum (University of Hamburg) and Gabriel Yvon-Durocher (University of Exeter), we aimed to disentangle the effects that ecology, physiology and evolutionary history have on the temperature dependence of photosynthesis in phytoplankton communities. Using an experimental set-up of phytoplankton communities that have been evolving in ambient and heated freshwater ponds for ten years, we characterised the temperature dependence of photosythesis over the course of a year.
