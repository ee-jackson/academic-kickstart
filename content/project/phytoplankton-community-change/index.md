Phytoplankton are the foundation of aquatic food-webs and contribute to 50% of global primary production. In a rapidly changing climate, we expect phytoplankton to adapt and change, with repercussions for aquatic ecosystems.

During my undergraduate degree, I worked with Gabriel Yvon-Durocher (University of Exeter) and Elisa Schaum (University of Hamburg), to disentangle the roles of ecology, physiology and evolutionary history, in the adaption of phytoplankton to environmental change.
