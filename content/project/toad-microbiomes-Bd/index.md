[Chytridiomycosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chytridiomycosis), a fatal skin disease caused by the fungal pathogen [_Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batrachochytrium_dendrobatidis), is responsible for widespread declines and extinctions of amphibian species.

Bacterial communities associated with multicellular hosts ([microbiomes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbiome)) are well documented for their vital role in maintaining host health. Commensal bacteria resident on amphibian skin can inhibit the growth of _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_, and in doing so confer survival benefits to the host, suggesting that there may be a way to use probiotic therapy as a conservation strategy to mitigate the loss of amphibian species.

During my Master's degree, I worked with Xavier Harrison and Kieran Bates at the [Zoological Society of London](https://www.zsl.org/science), to identify potential candidates for probiotic inoculation. I isolated and identified bacteria from the amphibian microbiome using 16s rRNA sequencing. Using a culture-based method, I then assessed the inhibitory capabilities of isolates against the fungal pathogen _Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis_.
