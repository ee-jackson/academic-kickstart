The second of my 16-week research projects undertaken as a part of my MRes was based at the Natural History Museum (NHM), London. I could, and do, wax lyrical on the beauty and grandeur of this place. I remember visiting London as a wildlife loving 12-year-old and my dad saying "you could work there one day".

My project at the NHM was my first foray into the study of truly 'wild' communities and naturally diverse environments. I was working with samples of microbial mat communities from meltwater ponds in Antartica.

The McMurdo Ice Shelf in Antartica forms an 50m thick undulating surface of ice floating on the sea. Annual summer thawing of ice and snow causes the formation of thousands of ponds in depressions on the ice. Variable ammounts of trapped marine sediments and salt are released from the ice as it melts. This results in ponds which are very close together in space and yet at opposite ends of the spectrum in terms of salinity and pH. 

The meltwater ponds of the McMurdo Ice Shelf are colonised by microbial mats, one of the few things that can survive in these extreme environments. Microbial mats are one of the earliest signs of life on earth, thought to have been present 4,000 million years ago (https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.1999.0934). They owe their hardiness to their co-operative nature. The mats are actually composed of lots of different kinds of microorganisms, organised into a multi-layered, three dimentional sheet. Each layer contains organisms with a different functional role. There are oxygen- and sun- loving cyanobacteria in the upper layers gradually giving way to  anaerobic and sulfate- loving bacteria at the lowest levels, with many other groups inbetween. The cyanobacteria at the top convert sunlight into energy and the waste products of the organisms at each layer are then food for the layer below them.

We wanted to find out more about how the different environmental contitions in the ponds related to the community composition of microbial mats.

## What did we do?

We decided to test if communities from mats in the same pond were more similar to each other than communities from mats in different ponds.
