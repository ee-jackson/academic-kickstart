Conspecific negative density dependence (CNDD) is a mechanism which works to maintain high plant biodiversity and can be described as a reduction in establishment, survival, and/or growth rates when conspecific densities are high. This is often due to host-specific plant enemies, such as insect herbivores and fungal pathogens, occurring in high densities at their host plant species. The [Janzen-Connell hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janzenâ€“Connell_hypothesis) proposes that enemy-driven CNDD is what maintains the hyperdiversity of tree species in tropical forests.

Enemy-driven CNDD has been studied extensively in tropical forests, but does this also happen in temperate forests, and to what extent? With [Sofia Gripenberg](https://www.reading.ac.uk/biologicalsciences/s-gripenberg.aspx), my PhD supervisor, we are establishing a new study system in [Wytham Woods](https://www.wythamwoods.ox.ac.uk), Oxfordshire, which will parallel <a href="https://www.eleanor-jackson.com/project/seed-predators/" target="_self">our work in Panama</a>. We are particularly interested in the role of pre-dispersal seed enemies in causing CNDD and have been monitoring premature fruit drop in _Crataegus monogyna_ in relation to the spatial distribution of individual trees. We are also rearing insects from fruits and seeds collected at Wytham to build a food web of internally feeding seed predators, which will enable us to determine the host-specificity of these plant enemies at Wytham.
