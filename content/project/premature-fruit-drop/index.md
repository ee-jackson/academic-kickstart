##Why do plants drop their fruits before they are fully ripe?
Walking around a tropical forest it is not uncommon to come across unripened fruits on the floor. Trees will often abort the development of their offspring (seeds) if deemed unlikely to reach adulthood as a plant, allowing them to fall and die. This may seem wasteful, however, growing fruits to ..fruition is energetically expensive for the plant and with limited resources it can often be more beneficial for a plant to cut its losses.
Another reason why a plant may prematurely abort it's fruits is if the offspring is damaged in any way. Fruits contain energy-rich sugars and nutrients to attract seed dispersers, however, many groups of animals have become seed predators. They differ from seed dispersers, as rather than eating the fruit and leaving the seed unharmed, a seed predator will eat the seed killing it in the process. The seed itself is an individual organism (or soon to be one), hence the term 'predator' rather than 'herbivore'.
One of the more widespread groups of seed predators is internally-feeding insects, which will lay their eggs on fruits and spend their larval phase feeding on the plant's seeds.
The first project of my PhD is going to be focused on how the population dynamics of insect seed predators affect rates of premature fruit drop in tropical plants and how this in turn, could have an effect on the make-up of plants in these forests.
