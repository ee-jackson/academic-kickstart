Walking around a tropical forest it is not uncommon to come across unripened fruits on the floor. Trees will often abort the development of their offspring (seeds) if deemed unlikely to reach adulthood as a plant, allowing them to fall and die. This may seem wasteful, however, growing fruits to fruition is energetically expensive for the plant. With limited resources, it can often be more beneficial for a plant to cut its losses and abort its fruits.

Plants may prematurely abort their fruits if the offspring becomes damaged. Fruits contain energy-rich sugars and nutrients to attract dispersal agents, however, many groups of animals have become seed predators. They differ from seed dispersers, as rather than digesting the fruit and leaving the seed unharmed, a seed predator will eat the seed, killing it in the process. The seed itself is an individual organism (or soon to be one), hence the term 'predator' rather than 'herbivore'.

One of the more widespread groups of seed predators in tropical forests are internally-feeding insects, which will lay their eggs on fruits and spend their larval phase feeding on the plant's seeds. The vast majority are highly host-specific, with each species of insect predating upon a single plant species.

If pre-dispersal seed predators are the cause of some premature fruit drop they would reduce recruitment in a non-random way, potentially contributing to the maintenance of tropical plant diversity.

In collaboration with my PhD supervisor Sofia Gripenberg (University of Reading) and Joe Wright (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute), I will investigate inter- and intra- specific patterns of premature fruit drop across time and space using a 30-year dataset of fruit drop from a Panamanian forest.
